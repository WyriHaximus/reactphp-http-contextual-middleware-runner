# Install

To install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), use the command below, it will automatically detect the latest version and bind it with `^`.

```
composer require wyrihaximus/react-http-contextual-middleware-runner
```

This middleware removes the raw body from the request. Best used after the request body has been parsed.

# Usage

In the following example the [`CORS`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) to allow everything in 
the `/css/` and `/js/` and by falling back to [`christoph-kluge/reactphp-http-cors-middleware`](https://github.com/christoph-kluge/reactphp-http-cors-middleware) 
for everything else.

**Note: This is an actual use case from [`WyriMaps.net`](https://www.wyrimaps.net) where there is an embeddable map 
`JS`, `CSS`, and images files served from that domain.**

```php
$server = new Server([
    /** Other Middleware */
    new ContextualMiddlewareRunner(
        function (ServerRequestInterface $request) {
            if (substr($request->getUri()->getPath(), 0, 4) === '/js/') {
                return true;
            }

            if (substr($request->getUri()->getPath(), 0, 5) === '/img/') {
                return true;
            }

            if (substr($request->getUri()->getPath(), 0, 5) === '/css/') {
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        },
        [
            new WithHeadersMiddleware([
                'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' => '*',
            ]),
        ],
        [
            // Middleware from christoph-kluge/reactphp-http-cors-middleware, not shipping with this package!!!
            // (But highly reccomended!)
            new CorsMiddleware([
                'allow_origin' => [
                    'https://www.wyrimaps.net',
                ],
            ]),
        ]
    )
    /** Other Middleware */
]);
```
